# Quick start to developing the plugin locally

Your local environment needs to be configured to work with `wp-env`.

Ensure you have fulfilled the [prerequisites](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/#prerequisites).

Using a package manager of your choice (in this case, we are using `pnpm`), enter:

```
pnpm i
pnpm run start
```

Your WordPress site should now be running on `localhost:8888`
