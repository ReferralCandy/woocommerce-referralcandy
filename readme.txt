* Get more sales from word-of-mouth
* Reward customers for referring their friends to your store

= How ReferralCandy works: =

* A customer buys something from your store
* We send them a coupon code to share with friends
* When their friends buy from you, the customer receives a referral reward

Everybody wins: your original customer gets rewarded, their friends get a discount, you make more sales and get a new customer! We do all the referral tracking, so you don't have to do anything.

= Features Include: =

* **Unlimited visitors and unlimited advocates.** The more customers and advocates in your referral program, the more word-of-mouth sales you'll get. With ReferralCandy, you can make your referral program as big as possible, so you'll never have to worry about hitting account limits. (There aren't any.)
* **Zero admin work for giving out rewards.** ReferralCandy can fully automate sending out coupon or cash rewards to your customers and their friends. We'll keep an eye on your campaigns so you can get back to running your store.
* **Complete control over your referral program.** Change any part of your referral program (reward structure, look and feel) via the self-serve ReferralCandy dashboard.
* **Social Integration.** ReferralCandy automatically nudges your advocates to share their referral links on Twitter and Facebook, giving your store exposure.
* **Easy customization for your brand.** Use our templates to quickly get your referral campaigns live. For advanced theming, we also have a white label option.
